At this point location, the uppermost surface geology is composed of a sandstone and shale unit from the Upper Cretaceous period, approximately 80 million years ago. This unit was likely deposited in a shallow marine environment. Below this is a limestone and shale unit from the Lower Cretaceous period, approximately 100 million years ago.These rock units are part of the regional geology of the area, which is characterized by a complex tectonic history. The Bocas Del Toro region is located on the Caribbean Plate, which is moving eastward and colliding with the South American Plate. This collision has resulted in the formation of the Central American Volcanic Arc, which includes the nearby Baru Volcano.The limestone and shale unit we see here was deposited during a time when the area was covered by a shallow sea. The sandstone and shale unit above it was deposited during a time of transgression, when the sea level rose and covered the area once again. These sedimentary rocks were then uplifted and folded during the tectonic activity associated with the formation of the Central American Volcanic Arc.In addition to these sedimentary rocks, the region is also home to igneous rocks such as the Baru Volcano, which erupted during the Quaternary period. These volcanic rocks are evidence of the ongoing tectonic activity in the area.Overall, the geologic history of Bocas Del Toro is complex and fascinating, with evidence of both sedimentary and igneous processes. By studying the rocks and landforms of the area, we can gain a better understanding of the tectonic forces that have shaped this region over millions of years.", "date": "2023-05-01 20:53:22"}]
