# On Large Language Models and Roadside Bot Geologists

## The Premise

Although geology education mostly takes place in the classroom, getting out to see rocks outcropping in 
the real world is a core part of geology training, be it in a university or as part of an occupation. 
Listening to someone speak about the details of the rocks in front of them at the side of a cliff, interpret 
their features, put them into the regional context, or speak to it as an excellent example of some concept 
is a core experience shared by nearly everyone who calls themselves a geologist. There is an entire collection 
books called "roadside geology of ____ ", because understanding the geology of point locations across a 
transit as a way to understand the larger geological picture is a core experience. The information is organized 
to parallel that experience. 

Of course, this experience requires someone knowledgable about the geology of the area, who is already 
familiar with all the stops as well as many others in the area. They've likely spent considerable time 
researching the geology of the area beforehand as well as time organizing the information into content 
that can be delivered at each stop along the field trip. This person is not always available though. 
Sometimes a geologist, or anyone interested in geology, is just driving along in their car, riding a 
train, sitting in a plane, or even not moving and just interested in the geology of one or more points 
on planet Earth. 

_Can they get similiar information delivered in a similar way, without being on a geology field trip?_

As machine learning, natural language processing, and technology in general continue to improve, it starts
to become more reasonable to think about automating some of this information delivering. This document 
poses the question of how far we are from having an AI geology professor in the field? It attempts to 
identify what do large language models make easier that was previously harder to accomplish and what 
difficult problems remain?
