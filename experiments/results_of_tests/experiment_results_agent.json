        "geology_response": "The geology of Port Clinton, Ohio, USA is a story of ancient seas, glacial advances and retreats, and the deposition of sedimentary rocks. The top two layers of the stratigraphic column at this location are separated by millions of years. The top layer is from 0.0117 to 2.58 million years old and is composed of 48.81% gravel, 44.05% sand, and 7.14% clay. The predicted depositional environment is a combination of glacial and lacustrine, with 66.67% glacial and 33.33% lacustrine. The second layer is from 358.9 to 398.6625 million years old and is composed of 37.5% shale, 12.5% sandstone, 31.25% limestone, and 18.75% dolomite. The predicted depositional environment is a combination of marine and inferred marine, with 6.25% marine and 93.75% inferred marine. Prior to the Pleistocene, the region was part of the Devonian Period, which lasted from about 419.2 to 358.9 million years ago. During this time, the area was covered by a shallow sea that deposited",

        "geology_response": "Banff, Alberta is located in the Canadian Rockies, which were formed during the Laramide orogeny around 70-40 million years ago. The rocks in the area are primarily sedimentary, with some volcanic and intrusive rocks. Around 2.58 million years ago, during the Pleistocene epoch, glaciers covered the area and carved out the valleys and mountains we see today. The rocks around Banff that are 0-2.58 million years old are primarily glacial deposits, including till, moraines, and outwash. These deposits were left behind by the retreating glaciers and are visible in the valleys and along the sides of the mountains. In addition to the glacial deposits, there are also some volcanic rocks in the area that are around 2 million years old. These rocks were formed by eruptions from nearby volcanoes and can be seen in places like Tunnel Mountain. Overall, the geologic story of Banff is one of mountain building, glaciation, and volcanic activity. The rocks and landforms in the area are a testament to the powerful forces that have shaped the Canadian Rockies over millions of years.",
