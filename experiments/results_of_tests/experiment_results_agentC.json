Both layers are from the Cenozoic era and have a predicted depositional environment of volcanic rocks.\n          --- end outcrop geology of point location ---\n          You do not need to repeat any of that again! If you mention rocks of the same age, refer back to them like 'as mentioned the rocks of age...'\n          Now start from the end of that statement and describe to students the regional geology around that local point geology. \n          Start with the phrase 'Now stepping back to talk about the regional geology around this area'\n          Break it down by time period in narrative fashion over 8-12 sentences that flow from what you previously said about the outcrop geology of point location.\n          "], "location": "Rome, Lazio, Italy", "geology_response": ["The uppermost surface geology at the local point location at the center of Rome, Lazio, Italy is Quaternary tephrite, which is composed of 65% tephrite, 76% basanite, and 196% of a mix of phonolitic tephrite, tephritic phonolite, tuff group, nephelinic, leucitic and analcitic rocks.

The youngest rocks in the area range from 0-66 million years old and are part of the Cenozoic Era. During the Paleogene Period (66-23 million years ago), the area was covered by a shallow sea, which deposited limestone and marl. During the Neogene Period (23-2.6 million years ago), volcanic activity occurred, resulting in the formation of the Alban Hills and the Colli Albani. These volcanic rocks are composed of tuff, ash, and lava flows. The most recent volcanic activity occurred around 36,000 years ago, resulting in the formation of the volcanic complex of the Monti Sabatini. The area is also characterized by alluvial deposits, which were formed by the Tiber River and its tributaries. These deposits consist of sand, gravel, and clay. Overall, the geology around Rome is a testament to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the Earth's surface."], "date": "2023-04-30 00:20:22"}]
