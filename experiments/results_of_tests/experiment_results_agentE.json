As we stand here, we can observe the top stratigraphic layer at this location, which is the Manhattan Formation, undivided. This formation is Middle Ordovician in age and is composed of pelitic schist, gneiss, and amphibolite. It is part of the Trenton Group and Metamorphic Equivalents, and is up to 8000 ft. (2400 m) thick. It is composed of three units: Omb, Omc, and Omd.The Manhattan Formation is just a small part of the larger geologic story of the region. The rocks in this area were formed during the Taconic Orogeny, a mountain-building event that occurred during the Ordovician period. During this time, the North American continent collided with a volcanic island arc, causing the formation of the Taconic Mountains.Over time, erosion wore down the mountains, and the sediments that were eroded from them were deposited in the surrounding areas. These sediments were then buried and subjected to heat and pressure, which caused them to undergo metamorphism and become the rocks we see today.The rocks in this area are also affected by the Hudson River, which has cut through the bedrock and exposed the layers we see today. The Hudson River is a result of the last ice age, which ended about 10,000 years ago.Overall, the geologic history of this region is complex and fascinating.

The Salina Group is a Silurian-age unit composed of dolostone, with occasional thin beds and laminae of dark gray shale, anhydrite, and/or gypsum. The Silurian sedimentary rocks are also Silurian-age and composed of sedimentary rocks. Both of these units were likely deposited in a shallow marine environment.The Salina Group and Silurian sedimentary rocks are part of the larger regional geology of the Appalachian Basin. The Appalachian Basin is a sedimentary basin that extends from Alabama to Canada and is composed of a series of sedimentary rocks that were deposited over millions of years. The Salina Group and Silurian sedimentary rocks were deposited during the Silurian period, which occurred approximately 443 to 416 million years ago.During the Silurian period, the Appalachian Basin was a shallow marine environment, with warm, shallow seas covering much of the region. The Salina Group and Silurian sedimentary rocks were deposited in this environment, with the dolostone of the Salina Group forming from the precipitation of calcium and magnesium carbonate in the seawater. The dark gray shale, anhydrite, and/or gypsum layers were likely formed from the settling of fine sediment particles in the seawater.Over time, the Appalachian Basin underwent a series of tectonic events, including the collision of the North American and African plates, which caused the formation of the Appalachian Mountains. The Salina Group and Silurian sedimentary rocks were uplifted and exposed to the surface, where they were subjected to weathering and erosion.Today, the Salina Group and Silurian sedimentary rocks are important sources of groundwater and oil and gas reserves in the region.

The youngest uppermost rocks in this area range from 0-1000 million years old and can be divided into three main time periods: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras.During the Paleozoic era, this region was covered by a shallow sea, and sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and shale were deposited. These rocks can be found in the nearby mountains. As we move forward in time, during the Mesozoic era, the South Atlantic Ocean began to form, and the region experienced volcanic activity. This resulted in the formation of basaltic rocks, which can be seen in the coastal cliffs.The Neoproterozoic crystalline metamorphic rocks we are standing on were formed during the Grenvillian orogeny, which occurred around 1.3 billion years ago. This orogeny was a result of the collision of two continents, which caused intense heat and pressure to be exerted on the rocks, resulting in their metamorphism. These rocks are part of the Rio de Janeiro State Basement Complex, which is a large area of crystalline rocks that extends throughout the state.Moving forward in time, during the Cenozoic era, the region experienced uplift and erosion, which exposed the older rocks and created the landscape we see today.
