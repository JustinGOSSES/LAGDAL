During the Miocene, the area was dominated by shallow marine environments, which were characterized by the deposition of limestone and sandstone. These rocks are now exposed in the hills surrounding Bocas del Toro. In the late Miocene to early Pliocene, the area was uplifted and subjected to erosion, which resulted in the deposition of conglomerates and sandstones. The Pliocene was characterized by the deposition of marine and terrestrial sediments, including sandstones, siltstones, and clays.
