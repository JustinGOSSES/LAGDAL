During the Paleozoic era, the region was home to marine life, swamps, amphibians, and early reptiles. The Mesozoic era saw the evolution and spread of dinosaurs across the continent. The Cenozoic era saw mammals dominate the land, with early whales swimming in the coastal waters. The oldest known eukaryotes lived during the Precambrian. The Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian periods of the Paleozoic era saw the formation of coral reefs, seed-bearing plants, and giant insects. Humans arrived across a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska.
